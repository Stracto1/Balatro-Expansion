-All Sprites, Major Coding and Player design (Stracto)
	-Modded character template (Catinsurance)
	-small snippets of code were taken from other mods/online (all credited in the code itself)

-tutorials used while in the making (Catinsurance, Lytebringr) (the GOATs fr)

-the base concept of this mod (LocalThunk and the hit game Balatro obv)

also i tried as much as possible to differ from the Balatro Jokers mod in terms of joker's general effects, but gotta say being a translator for said mod didn't quite help my imagination to flourish, so i'll list the jokers which were at least slightly inspired from it

-pareidolia (kinda)
-steel joker
-stone joker (has a similar effect but i technicaly came up with it much before the release of Balatro Jokers)

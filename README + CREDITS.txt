-All Sprites, Major Coding and Player design (Stracto)
	-Modded character template (Catinsurance)
	-small snippets of code were taken from other mods/online (all credited in the code itself)

-tutorials used while in the making (Catinsurance, Lytebringr) (the GOATs fr)

-the base concept of this mod (LocalThunk and the hit game Balatro obv)

-rain on umbrella sound effect taken from Zapsplat (https://www.zapsplat.com/music/medium-rain-falling-on-umbrella/)


also i tried as much as possible to differ from the Balatro Jokers mod in terms of joker's general effects, but gotta say being a translator for said mod didn't quite help my imagination to flourish

BTW if you're here to look at the mod's code then you're most likely be hit with shitty organisation and readability
this is basically my first attempt at making a content mod, so do don't have high expectations

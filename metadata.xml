[list]
[*]Due to the (shitty) way the normal character was made, there may be problems with local coop [i](please report ani issues so i can try my best to fix them!)[/i]
[*][b]The tainted character was not built to work neither in co-op or with modded floors/enemies[/b], so expect toencounter many bugs/softlocks if that's your case!
	[list][*]I'd love to make it StageAPI-compatible, but since I litterally couldn't understand shi from the docs given that's most likely not gonna happen ([i][u]if you know your thing with it and wanna help please let me know![/u][/i])[/list]
[*][b]The use of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836319872]EID[/url] is very recommended[/b] since ya know, Balatro was made with fully available descriptions in mind

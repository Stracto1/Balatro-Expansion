[list]
[*]Due to the (shitty) way the normal character was made, there may be problems with local coop [i](please report any issues so I can try my best to fix them!)[/i]
[*][b]The tainted character was not built to work neither in co-op or with modded floors/enemies[/b], so expect to encounter many bugs/softlocks if that's your case!
	[list][*]I'd love to make it StageAPI-compatible, but since I literally couldn't understand shi from the docs given that's most likely not gonna happen ([i][u]if you know your thing with it and wanna help please let me know![/u][/i])[/list]
[*][b]The use of [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=836319872]EID[/url] is highly recommended[/b] since ya know, Balatro was made with fully available descriptions in mind
[*]There's currently a known conflict with [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2978501842]Giga bombs synergies[/url] that causes a crash when a run is started, the exact cause is still being studied but until I find a solution I suggest to disable it while playing this mod and vice versa.
